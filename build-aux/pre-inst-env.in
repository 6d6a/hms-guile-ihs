# Usage: ./pre-inst-env COMMAND ARG...
#
# Run COMMAND in a pre-installation environment.  Typical use is
# "./pre-inst-env hms".

# By default we may end up with absolute directory names that contain '..',
# which get into $GUILE_LOAD_PATH, leading to '..' in the module file names
# recorded by Guile.  To avoid that, make sure we get a real absolute
# directory name.  Additionally, use '-P' to get the canonical directory name
# so that Guile's 'relative' %file-port-name-canonicalization can actually
# work (see <http://bugs.gnu.org/17935>.)
